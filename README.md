# Bayesian_Tumor_Growth

In this project, The propose implement Lattice Boltzmann Method and Crank Nicholson scheme to simulate the growth of a particlarly infiltrative tumor : grade IV gliomas, also called glioblastomas mutliformes (GBM). 
Data set MNI atlas to apply our growth model to real MRI (http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesAtlases/ICBM152NLin2009). 


This simulations to recover the results from the Spherical Asymptotic Analysis.
